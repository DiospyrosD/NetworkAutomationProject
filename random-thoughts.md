Ansible playbook is a very useful tool in automating the deployment of various IT systems including network infrastructures. If you want to use Ansible to deploy a network by taking an input YAML file and using network namespaces, veths, nftables, and Linux bridges, you need to ensure that Ansible is installed and fully functional in your system.

Please note that it is difficult to put together a fully functional playbook without precise details on how your network should be configured. However, here is a basic illustration of how an Ansible playbook would look like:

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  vars_files:
    - /path/to/your/input.yaml  # Change this to your real YAML file path

  tasks:

  - name: Create network namespace
    command: ip netns add {{ item }}
    with_items: "{{ netns }}"

  - name: Create veth pair
    command: ip link add {{ item.name }} type veth peer name {{ item.peer }}
    with_items: "{{ veth_pairs }}"

  - name: Attach veth endpoints to namespaces
    command: ip link set {{ item.veth }} netns {{ item.netns }}
    with_items: "{{ veth_to_netns }}"

  - name: Setup IP addresses for veth endpoints
    command: ip netns exec {{ item.netns }} ip address add {{ item.ip }} dev {{ item.dev }}
    with_items: "{{ veth_ips }}"

  - name: Create Linux bridges
    command: ip link add name {{ item }} type bridge
    with_items: "{{ bridges }}"

  - name: Setup IP addresses for bridges
    command: ip address add {{ item.ip }} dev {{ item.dev }}
    with_items: "{{ bridge_ips }}"

  - name: Add nftables rules
    command: nft {{ item }}
    with_items: "{{ nft_rules }}"
...
```

In the input.yaml use variables for netns, veth_pairs, veth_to_netns, veth_ips, bridges, bridge_ips, and nft_rules corresponding to your network infrastructure setup.

Please customize this playbook according to your specific setup and infrastructure details. If you have specific parameters such as the network interfaces, IP addresses, or network configurations, ensure you include them in your input YAML file and refer to them in your playbook. Ensure that the server upon which this playbook is run has the necessary permissions to execute these tasks. 

Note: Use the `command` or `shell` module responsibly, usage of these ansible modules signifies that there is probably a better way of achieving the underlying task. With the above playbook use it as a reference and see if Ansible has specific modules for any of those tasks for idempotency. Due to the fact that Ansible makes use of SSH, the network changes would not disrupt its operation. 

Lastly, always ensure to check your playbook for syntax correctness by using the `ansible-playbook --syntax-check your-playbook.yaml` command.
